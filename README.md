## **Introduction**  
This project focuses on three main challenges:  
1. Developing a **movie recommendation system** using techniques like **Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)**.
2. Group Similar Movies into **Clusters**
3. Solving a **game theory algorithmic problem** through dynamic programming.

## **Repository Content**  

The repository is organized as follows:  

- **`README.md`**: This document provides an overview of the repository, summarizing its contents and purpose.  

- **`main.ipynb`**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the core of the project and is divided into the following sections:  
  1. **Recommendation System with LSH**:  
     A recommendation system utilizing **Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)** 
  2. **Clustering (Sections 2 and 3)**:  
     Clustering techniques, including **K-Means**, to group movies.  
  3. **Algorithmic Question**:  
     A **game theory problem**, where two players compete to maximize their scores. The solution is implemented using dynamic programming to predict outcomes under optimal play.  
- **`kmeans_algorithm.py`**: This file contains the implementation of the K-means algorithm. This file is imported into the main script.
