#  *Homework 4 - GROUP - #5*


### *REPOSITORY CONTENT*

*This repository consists a Jupyter notebook titled 'main.ipynb', The notebook is divided into two main sections:*

*1. __MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM__ This project uses the MovieLens dataset to build a recommendation system by applying hashing for faster data retrieval and clustering to group users with similar movie preferences. The system analyzes user behavior and ratings to provide personalized movie suggestions efficiently. Key techniques include data preprocessing, K-Means clustering, and custom hash functions. Results showcase improved speed and accuracy in recommendations.*

*2. __ALGORITHM QUESTION__ Based on Arya and Mario who play a game by taking numbers from either end of a sequence to maximize their scores. Arya goes first. With both playing optimally, can Arya guarantee a win or tie?*

## *ALGORITHM QUESTION*

*Arya and Mario play a strategic game with a sequence of numbers, aiming to maximize their scores by taking numbers from either end of the sequence. Arya always starts, and both players play optimally. If scores tie, Arya wins by default. This project predicts whether Arya can guarantee a win under optimal conditions.*
